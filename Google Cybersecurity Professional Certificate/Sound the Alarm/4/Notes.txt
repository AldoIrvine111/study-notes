Best practices for log collection and management
In this reading, you’ll examine some best practices related to log management, storage, and protection. Understanding the best practices related to log collection and management will help improve log searches and better support your efforts in identifying and resolving security incidents.

Logs
Data sources such as devices generate data in the form of events. A log is a record of events that occur within an organization's systems. Logs contain log entries and each entry details information corresponding to a single event that happened on a device or system. Originally, logs served the sole purpose of troubleshooting common technology issues. For example, error logs provide information about why an unexpected error occurred and help to identify the root cause of the error so that it can be fixed. Today, virtually all computing devices produce some form of logs that provide valuable insights beyond troubleshooting. 

Security teams access logs from logging receivers like SIEM tools which consolidate logs to provide a central repository for log data. Security professionals use logs to perform log analysis, which is the process of examining logs to identify events of interest. Logs help uncover the details surrounding the 5 W's of incident investigation: who triggered the incident, what happened, when the incident took place, where the incident took place, and why the incident occurred. 

Types of logs
Depending on the data source, different log types can be produced. Here’s a list of some common log types that organizations should record:

Network: Network logs are generated by network devices like firewalls, routers, or switches.

System: System logs are generated by operating systems like Chrome OS™, Windows, Linux, or macOS®. 

Application: Application logs are generated by software applications and contain information relating to the events occurring within the application such as a smartphone app.

Security: Security logs are generated by various devices or systems such as antivirus software and intrusion detection systems. Security logs contain security-related information such as file deletion.

Authentication: Authentication logs are generated whenever authentication occurs such as a successful login attempt into a computer.

Log details
Generally, logs contain a date, time, location, action, and author of the action. Here is an example of an authentication log:

Login Event [05:45:15] User1 Authenticated successfully

Logs contain information and can be adjusted to contain even more information. Verbose logging records additional, detailed information beyond the default log recording. Here is an example of the same log above but logged as verbose.

Login Event [2022/11/16 05:45:15.892673] auth_performer.cc:470 User1 Authenticated successfully from device1 (192.168.1.2)

Log management
Because all devices produce logs, it can quickly become overwhelming for organizations to keep track of all the logs that are generated. To get the most value from your logs, you need to choose exactly what to log, how to access it easily, and keep it secure using log management. Log management is the process of collecting, storing, analyzing, and disposing of log data. 

What to log
The most important aspect of log management is choosing what to log. Organizations are different, and their logging requirements can differ too. It's important to consider which log sources are most likely to contain the most useful information depending on your event of interest. This might be configuring log sources to reduce the amount of data they record, such as excluding excessive verbosity. Some information, including but not limited to phone numbers, email addresses, and names, form personally identifiable information (PII), which requires special handling and in some jurisdictions might not be possible to be logged.

The issue with overlogging
From a security perspective, it can be tempting to log everything. This is the most common mistake organizations make. Just because it can be logged, doesn't mean it needs to be logged. Storing excessive amounts of logs can have many disadvantages with some SIEM tools. For example, overlogging can increase storage and maintenance costs. Additionally, overlogging can increase the load on systems, which can cause performance issues and affect usability, making it difficult to search for and identify important events. 

Log retention
Organizations might operate in industries with regulatory requirements. For example, some regulations require organizations to retain logs for set periods of time and organizations can implement log retention practices in their log management policy.

Organizations that operate in the following industries might need to modify their log management policy to meet regulatory requirements:

Public sector industries, like the Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA)

Healthcare industries, like the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)

Financial services industries, such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX)

Log protection
Along with management and retention, the protection of logs is vital in maintaining log integrity. It’s not unusual for malicious actors to modify logs in attempts to mislead security teams and to even hide their activity.

Storing logs in a centralized log server is a way to maintain log integrity. When logs are generated, they get sent to a dedicated server instead of getting stored on a local machine. This makes it more difficult for attackers to access logs because there is a barrier between the attacker and the log location. 

Key takeaways
It's important to understand how to properly collect, store, and protect logs because they are integral to incident investigations. Having a detailed plan for log management helps improve the usefulness of logs and resource efficiency.

Overview of log file formats
You’ve learned about how logs record events that happen on a network, or system. In security, logs provide key details about activities that occurred across an organization, like who signed into an application at a specific point in time. As a security analyst, you’ll use log analysis, which is the process of examining logs to identify events of interest. It’s important to know how to read and interpret different log formats so that you can uncover the key details surrounding an event and identify unusual or malicious activity. In this reading, you’ll review the following log formats:

JSON

Syslog

XML

CSV

CEF

JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a file format that is used to store and transmit data. JSON is known for being lightweight and easy to read and write. It is used for transmitting data in web technologies and is also commonly used in cloud environments. JSON syntax is derived from JavaScript syntax. If you are familiar with JavaScript, you might recognize that JSON contains components from JavaScript including:

Key-value pairs

Commas

Double quotes

Curly brackets

Square brackets

Key-value pairs
A key-value pair is a set of data that represents two linked items: a key and its corresponding value. A key-value pair consists of a key followed by a colon, and then followed by a value. An example of a key-value pair is  "Alert": "Malware".

Note: For readability, it is recommended that key-value pairs contain a space before or after the colon that separates the key and value.

Commas
Commas are used to separate data. For example: "Alert": "Malware", "Alert code": 1090, "severity": 10.

Double quotes
Double quotes are used to enclose text data, which is also known as a string, for example:  "Alert": "Malware". Data that contains numbers is not enclosed in quotes, like this: "Alert code": 1090.

Curly brackets
Curly brackets enclose an object, which is a data type that stores data in a comma-separated list of key-value pairs. Objects are often used to describe multiple properties for a given key. JSON log entries start and end with a curly bracket. In this example, User is the object that contains multiple properties:

"User":
{ 
    "id": "1234", 
    "name": "user",
    "role": "engineer"
}

Square brackets
Square brackets are used to enclose an array, which is a data type that stores data in a comma-separated ordered list. Arrays are useful when you want to store data as an ordered collection, for example: ["Administrators", "Users", "Engineering"].

Syslog
Syslog is a standard for logging and transmitting data. It can be used to refer to any of its three different capabilities: 

Protocol: The syslog protocol is used to transport logs to a centralized log server for log management. It uses port 514 for plaintext logs and port 6514 for encrypted logs.

Service: The syslog service acts as a log forwarding service that consolidates logs from multiple sources into a single location. The service works by receiving and then forwarding any syslog log entries to a remote server. 

Log format: The syslog log format is one of the most commonly used log formats that you will be focusing on. It is the native logging format used in  Unix® systems. It consists of three components: a header, structured-data, and a message.

Syslog log example
Here is an example of a syslog entry that contains all three components: a header, followed by structured-data, and a message:

<236>1 2022-03-21T01:11:11.003Z virtual.machine.com evntslog - ID01 [user@32473 iut="1" eventSource="Application" eventID="9999"] 
This is a log entry!

Header 
The header contains details like the timestamp; the hostname, which is the name of the machine that sends the log; the application name; and the message ID. 

Timestamp: The timestamp in this example is 2022-03-21T01:11:11.003Z, where 2022-03-21 is the date in YYYY-MM-DD format. T is used to separate the date and the time. 01:11:11.003 is the 24-hour format of the time and includes the number of milliseconds 003. Z indicates the timezone, which is Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). 

Hostname: virtual.machine.com 

Application: evntslog 

Message ID: ID01

Structured-data 
The structured-data portion of the log entry contains additional logging information. This information is enclosed in square brackets and structured in key-value pairs. Here, there are three keys with corresponding values: [user@32473 iut="1" eventSource="Application" eventID="9999"].

Message 
The message contains a detailed log message about the event. Here, the message is This is a log entry!.

Priority (PRI)
The priority (PRI) field indicates the urgency of the logged event and is contained with angle brackets. In this example, the priority value is <236> . Generally, the lower the priority level, the more urgent the event is. 

Note: Syslog headers can be combined with JSON, and XML formats. Custom log formats also exist.

XML (eXtensible Markup Language)
XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is a language and a format used for storing and transmitting data. XML is a native file format used in Windows systems. XML syntax uses the following:

Tags

Elements

Attributes

Tags 
XML uses tags to store and identify data. Tags are pairs that must contain a start tag and an end tag. The start tag encloses data with angle brackets, for example <tag>,  whereas the end of a tag encloses data with angle brackets and a forward slash like this: </tag>. 

Elements 
XML elements include both the data contained inside of a tag and the tags itself. All XML entries must contain at least one root element. Root elements contain other elements that sit underneath them, known as child elements. 

Here is an example:

<Event>	
    <EventID>4688</EventID>
    <Version>5</Version>
</Event>

In this example, <Event> is the root element and contains two child elements <EventID> and <Version>. There is data contained in each respective child element.

Attributes
XML elements can also contain attributes. Attributes are used to provide additional information about elements. Attributes are included as the second part of the tag itself and must always be quoted using either single or double quotes.

For example:

<EventData>
    <Data Name='SubjectUserSid'>S-2-3-11-160321</Data>
    <Data Name='SubjectUserName'>JSMITH</Data>
    <Data Name='SubjectDomainName'>ADCOMP</Data>
    <Data Name='SubjectLogonId'>0x1cf1c12</Data>
    <Data Name='NewProcessId'>0x1404</Data>
</EventData>

In the first line for this example, the tag is <Data> and it uses the attribute  Name='SubjectUserSid' to describe the data enclosed in the tag S-2-3-11-160321.

CSV (Comma Separated Value)
CSV (Comma Separated Value) uses commas to separate data values. In CSV logs, the position of the data corresponds to its field name, but the field names themselves might not be included in the log. It’s critical to understand what fields the source device (like an IPS, firewall, scanner, etc.) is including in the log. 

Here is an example:

2009-11-24T21:27:09.534255,ALERT,192.168.2.7, 1041,x.x.250.50,80,TCP,ALLOWED,1:2001999:9,"ET MALWARE BTGrab.com Spyware Downloading Ads",1

CEF (Common Event Format)
Common Event Format (CEF) is a log format that uses key-value pairs to structure data and identify fields and their corresponding values. The CEF syntax is defined as containing the following fields: 

CEF:Version|Device Vendor|Device Product|Device Version|Signature ID|Name|Severity|Extension 

Fields are all separated with a pipe character |. However, anything in the Extension part of the CEF log entry must be written in a key-value format. Syslog is a common method used to transport logs like CEF. When Syslog is used a timestamp and hostname will be prepended to the CEF message. Here is an example of a CEF log entry that details malicious activity relating to a worm infection:

Sep 29 08:26:10 host CEF:1|Security|threatmanager|1.0|100|worm successfully stopped|10|src=10.0.0.2 dst=2.1.2.2 spt=1232

Here is a breakdown of the fields:

Syslog Timestamp: Sep 29 08:26:10

Syslog Hostname: host

Version:  CEF:1

Device Vendor: Security

Device Product: threatmanager

Device Version: 1.0

Signature ID: 100

Name: worm successfully stopped

Severity: 10

Extension: This field contains data written as key-value pairs. There are two IP addresses, src=10.0.0.2 and dst=2.1.2.2, and a source port number spt=1232. Extensions are not required and are optional to add.

This log entry contains details about a Security application called threatmanager that successfully stopped a worm from spreading from the internal network at 10.0.0.2 to the external network 2.1.2.2 through the port 1232. A high severity level of 10 is reported.

Note: Extensions and syslog prefix are optional to add to a CEF log.

Key takeaways
There is no standard format used in logging, and many different log formats exist. As a security analyst, you will analyze logs that originate from different sources. Knowing how to interpret different log formats will help you determine key information that you can use to support your investigations.

Detection tools and techniques
In this reading, you’ll examine the different types of intrusion detection system (IDS) technologies and the alerts they produce. You’ll also explore the two common detection techniques used by detection systems. Understanding the capabilities and limitations of IDS technologies and their detection techniques will help you interpret security information to identify, analyze, and respond to security events.

As you’ve learned, an intrusion detection system (IDS) is an application that monitors system activity and alerts on possible intrusions. IDS technologies help organizations monitor the activity that happens on their systems and networks to identify indications of malicious activity.  Depending on the location you choose to set up an IDS, it can be either host-based or network-based.

Host-based intrusion detection system
A host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS) is an application that monitors the activity of the host on which it's installed. A HIDS is installed as an agent on a host. A host is also known as an endpoint, which is any device connected to a network like a computer or a server. 

Typically, HIDS agents are installed on all endpoints and used to monitor and detect security threats. A HIDS monitors internal activity happening on the host to identify any unauthorized or abnormal behavior. If anything unusual is detected, such as the installation of an unauthorized application, the HIDS logs it and sends out an alert. 

In addition to monitoring inbound and outbound traffic flows, HIDS can have additional capabilities, such as monitoring file systems, system resource usage, user activity, and more. 

This diagram shows a HIDS tool installed on a computer. The dotted circle around the host indicates that it is only monitoring the local activity on the single computer on which it’s installed. 

A network diagram with a host-based intrusion detection system monitoring a single computer.
Network-based intrusion detection system
A network-based intrusion detection system (NIDS) is an application that collects and monitors network traffic and network data. NIDS software is installed on devices located at specific parts of the network that you want to monitor. The NIDS application inspects network traffic from different devices on the network. If any malicious network traffic is detected, the NIDS logs it and generates an alert.

This diagram shows a NIDS that is installed on a network. The highlighted circle around the server and computers indicates that the NIDS is installed on the server and is monitoring the activity of the computers.

network communications between multiple computers
Using a combination of HIDS and NIDS to monitor an environment can provide a multi-layered approach to intrusion detection and response. HIDS and NIDS tools provide a different perspective on the activity occurring on a network and the individual hosts that are connected to it. This helps provide a comprehensive view of the activity happening in an environment.

Detection techniques
Detection systems can use different techniques to detect threats and attacks. The two types of detection techniques that are commonly used by IDS technologies are signature-based analysis and anomaly-based analysis.

Signature-based analysis
Signature analysis, or signature-based analysis, is a detection method that is used to find events of interest. A signature is a pattern that is associated with malicious activity. Signatures can contain specific patterns like a sequence of binary numbers, bytes, or even specific data like an IP address. 

Previously, you explored the Pyramid of Pain, which is a concept that prioritizes the different types of indicators of compromise (IoCs) associated with an attack or threat, such as IP addresses, tools, tactics, techniques, and more. IoCs and other indicators of attack can be useful for creating targeted signatures to detect and block attacks.

Different types of signatures can be used depending on which type of threat or attack you want to detect. For example, an anti-malware signature contains patterns associated with malware. This can include malicious scripts that are used by the malware. IDS tools will monitor an environment for events that match the patterns defined in this malware signature. If an event matches the signature, the event gets logged and an alert is generated. 

Advantages
Low rate of false positives: Signature-based analysis is very efficient at detecting known threats because it is simply comparing activity to signatures. This leads to fewer false positives. Remember that a false positive is an alert that incorrectly detects the presence of a threat.

Disadvantages
Signatures can be evaded: Signatures are unique, and attackers can modify their attack behaviors to bypass the signatures. For example, attackers can make slight modifications to malware code to alter its signature and avoid detection.

Signatures require updates: Signature-based analysis relies on a database of signatures to detect threats. Each time a new exploit or attack is discovered, new signatures must be created and added to the signature database.

Inability to detect unknown threats: Signature-based analysis relies on detecting known threats through signatures. Unknown threats can't be detected, such as new malware families or zero-day attacks, which are exploits that were previously unknown. 

Anomaly-based analysis
Anomaly-based analysis is a detection method that identifies abnormal behavior. There are two phases to anomaly-based analysis: a training phase and a detection phase. In the training phase, a baseline of normal or expected behavior must be established. Baselines are developed by collecting data that corresponds to normal system behavior. In the detection phase, the current system activity is compared against this baseline. Activity that happens outside of the baseline gets logged, and an alert is generated. 

Advantages
Ability to detect new and evolving threats: Unlike signature-based analysis, which uses known patterns to detect threats, anomaly-based analysis can detect unknown threats.

Disadvantages
High rate of false positives: Any behavior that deviates from the baseline can be flagged as abnormal, including non-malicious behaviors. This leads to a high rate of false positives.

Pre-existing compromise: The existence of an attacker during the training phase will include malicious behavior in the baseline. This can lead to missing a pre-existing attacker.

Key takeaways
IDS technologies are an essential security tool that you will encounter in your security journey. To recap, a NIDS monitors an entire network, whereas a HIDS monitors individual endpoints. IDS technologies generate different types of alerts. Lastly, IDS technologies use different detection techniques like signature-based or anomaly-based analysis to identify malicious activity.

Overview of Suricata
So far, you've learned about detection signatures and you were introduced to Suricata, an intrusion detection system (IDS).

In this reading, you’ll explore more about Suricata. You'll also learn about the value of writing customized signatures and configuration. This is an important skill to build in your cybersecurity career because you might be tasked with deploying and maintaining IDS tools.

Introduction to Suricata
Suricata
 is an open-source intrusion detection system, intrusion prevention system, and network analysis tool.

Suricata features
There are three main ways Suricata can be used:

Intrusion detection system (IDS): As a network-based IDS, Suricata can monitor network traffic and alert on suspicious activities and intrusions. Suricata can also be set up as a host-based IDS to monitor the system and network activities of a single host like a computer.

Intrusion prevention system (IPS): Suricata can also function as an intrusion prevention system (IPS) to detect and block malicious activity and traffic. Running Suricata in IPS mode requires additional configuration such as enabling IPS mode. 

Network security monitoring (NSM): In this mode, Suricata helps keep networks safe by producing and saving relevant network logs. Suricata can analyze live network traffic, existing packet capture files, and create and save full or conditional packet captures. This can be useful for forensics, incident response, and for testing signatures. For example, you can trigger an alert and capture the live network traffic to generate traffic logs, which you can then analyze to refine detection signatures.

Rules 
Rules or signatures are used to identify specific patterns, behavior, and conditions of network traffic that might indicate malicious activity. The terms rule and signature are often used interchangeably in Suricata. Security analysts use signatures, or patterns associated with malicious activity, to detect and alert on specific malicious activity. Rules can also be used to provide additional context and visibility into systems and networks, helping to identify potential security threats or vulnerabilities. 

Suricata uses signatures analysis, which is a detection method used to find events of interest. Signatures consist of three components:

 Action: The first component of a signature. It describes the action to take if network or system activity matches the signature. Examples include: alert, pass, drop, or reject.

Header: The header includes network traffic information like source and destination IP addresses, source and destination ports, protocol, and traffic direction.

Rule options: The rule options provide you with different options to customize signatures.

Here's an example of a Suricata signature:

A Suricata signature with an action, header, and rule options.
Rule options have a specific ordering and changing their order would change the meaning of the rule.

Note: The terms rule and signature are synonymous.

Note: Rule order refers to the order in which rules are evaluated by Suricata. Rules are processed in the order in which they are defined in the configuration file. However, Suricata processes rules in a different default order: pass, drop, reject, and alert. Rule order affects the final verdict of a packet especially when conflicting actions such as a drop rule and an alert rule both match on the same packet.

Custom rules
Although Suricata comes with pre-written rules, it is highly recommended that you modify or customize the existing rules to meet your specific security requirements. 

There is no one-size-fits-all approach to creating and modifying rules. This is because each organization's IT infrastructure differs. Security teams must extensively test and modify detection signatures according to their needs.

Creating custom rules helps to tailor detection and monitoring. Custom rules help to minimize the amount of false positive alerts that security teams receive. It's important to develop the ability to write effective and customized signatures so that you can fully leverage the power of detection technologies.

Configuration file
Before detection tools are deployed and can begin monitoring systems and networks, you must properly configure their settings so that they know what to do. A configuration file is a file used to configure the settings of an application. Configuration files let you customize exactly how you want your IDS to interact with the rest of your environment. 

Suricata's configuration file is suricata.yaml, which uses the YAML file format for syntax and structure.

Log files
There are two log files that Suricata generates when alerts are triggered:

eve.json: The eve.json file is the standard Suricata log file. This file contains detailed information and metadata about the events and alerts generated by Suricata stored in JSON format. For example, events in this file contain a unique identifier called flow_id  which is used to correlate related logs or alerts to a single network flow, making it easier to analyze network traffic. The eve.json file is used for more detailed analysis and is considered to be a better file format for log parsing and SIEM log ingestion.

fast.log: The fast.log file is used to record minimal alert information including basic IP address and port details about the network traffic. The fast.log file is used for basic logging and alerting and is considered a legacy file format and is not suitable for incident response or threat hunting tasks.

The main difference between the eve.json file and the fast.log file is the level of detail that is recorded in each. The fast.log file records basic information, whereas the eve.json file contains additional verbose information. 

Key takeaways
In this reading, you explored some of Suricata's features, rules syntax, and the importance of configuration. Understanding how to configure detection technologies and write effective rules will provide you with clear insight into the activity happening in an environment so that you can improve detection capability and network visibility. Go ahead and start practicing using Suricata in the upcoming activity!
